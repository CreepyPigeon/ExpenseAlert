  # ExpenseAlert
  Project made by Nechita Cosmin
  
  ExpenseAlert monitors a directory for any new invoices as XML files.
These invoices are added to a sql database to be stored.
If the expenses for a certain category of invoices are over the set limit, 
the user is prompted with an alert popup.

  ExpenseAlert currently runs in a terminal, with a GUI to be added in the future.
